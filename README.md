# Bug_fixes_for_the_hundredrabbits_repo
Minor fixes and enhancements to the HundredRabbits Macintosh Pascal repos 

Hundredrabbits has some *excellent* Pascal code snippets and full programs. At least some of the examples seem to have come from [SpInsideMacintosh](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Macintosh-Cookbook/blob/master/docs/im202.html), which is also included in the repo.

There are in fact, two repos:

- [hundredrabbits](https://github.com/hundredrabbits)/[Macintosh-Cookbook](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Macintosh-Cookbook)
- [https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/macintosh-cookbook/tree/master](https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/macintosh-cookbook/tree/master)

There are a few bugs in a couple of the files that needed ironing out. It is these files that I have added here. Some additional directories have also been added that expand, or enhance, the existing examples.

One such example is [ExampleScene](), where I have added some additional primitives, such as a pyramid and a trapezium/rhombus
